# Flex + Bison Parser

This repository contains my **lexer and parser implementation** using:

- **Flex** (`.flx`) for lexical analysis (tokenization)
- **Bison/Yacc** (`.y`) for parsing according to a context-free grammar

---

## My Contribution

I independently implemented:
- Token definitions and scanning rules in `flex.flx`
- Grammar rules, precedence/associativity (if used), and parsing actions in `bison.y`
- Error handling for invalid tokens and/or invalid syntax (based on the assignment requirements)
